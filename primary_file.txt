Benaulim: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday held a bilateral meeting with his Bhutanese counterpart Tshering Tobgay ahead of the BRICS-Bimstec Outreach Summit during which the two leaders discussed the entire spectrum of bilateral relations.

"Always a delight meeting you PM @tsheringtobgay. Glad to have discussed the full spectrum of India-Bhutan ties during our talks," Modi stated in a tweet.

Earlier on Sunday, Modi also met Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena.

As host of this year`s BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) Summit, India, as is the practice, can invite neighbouring countries to join in for an outreach summit.

Following last month`s cross-border terror attack on an Indian Army camp at Uri in Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 19 Indian soldiers, India chose to invite countries belonging to the Bimstec grouping over those of Saarc.

Countries belonging to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) are India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.

New Delhi blamed Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed for the Uri attack and launched a diplomatic blitz to isolate Islamabad in the international community.

The invitation to Bimstec countries instead of the Saarc countries is being seen as another step in this direction.

Pakistan, Afghanistan and Maldives are the members of the South Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) that are also not members of Bimstec.

Pakistan and China are two friends
